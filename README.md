The aim of the project is to perform exploratory data analysis to uncover interesting patterns, insights, and potential anomalies within the Movie dataset.
# Data Overview and Cleaning:
The dataset has 1000 entries and 12 columns which are;
Rank

Title

Genre

Description

Director

Actors

Year

Runtime (Minutes)

Rating

Votes

Revenue (Millions)

Metascore

The dataset do not have any missing values, but has null values which i cleaned.

# Key Insights
1.Ratings and Votes: 
The average movie rating is 6.72, with a standard deviation of 0.94. The most votes received by a movie is nearly 1.8 million, while the least is just 61 votes. 
This shows a wide range in the popularity and audience reception of the movies.

2.Revenue: 
The revenue data has some missing values (872 out of 1,000 entries). 
The highest reported revenue is $936.63 million, while some movies reported zero revenue, possibly due to lack of data or low box office performance.

3.Metascore: 
The average metascore is 59 out of 100, indicating a tendency towards middle-ground critical reception.
The standard deviation of 17.2 suggests variability in critical reception among the movies.

4.Runtime:
The runtime of movies ranges from 66 to 191 minutes, with an average runtime of approximately 113 minutes.
Most movies are within the 100-123 minute range.

5.Year of Release: 
The movies span from 2006 to 2016, with the majority released in more recent years (2010-2016).

# Interesting Findings
1.Revenue Distribution:
A significant portion of movies have relatively low revenue, with only a few blockbuster movies generating over $500 million.

2.Genre Variety: 
Many movies have multiple genres, indicating a trend towards genre-blending in the film industry.

3.Metascore vs. Revenue: 
Some movies with low metascores still achieved high revenues, suggesting that critical reception doesn't always align with box office success.

# Dashboard

I used Power BI as my visualization tool to create an interactive dashboard that a user can control based on their preference by use of filters created to enhance the interactivity. 

There is a link of 2 videos recording containing further and deeper explanation of jupyter notebook work and power bi visualization.
